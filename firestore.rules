/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a combination of ownership-based and role-based access control.
 * User-specific data is secured under the `/users/{userId}` path, ensuring only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 * Public data, such as system health and audit logs, is readable by all users, but write access is restricted.
 * Team and Role data are used to enforce role-based access control.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /systemHealth/{healthId}: Stores system health records, publicly readable.
 * - /auditLogs/{logId}: Stores audit logs, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/favoriteActions/{actionId}: Stores a user's favorite actions; only accessible by the user.
 * - /teams/{teamId}: Stores team information.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user information; only accessible by the user.
 * - /roles/{roleId}: Stores role information.
 * - /services/{serviceId}: Stores service data.
 * - /connections/{connectionId}: Stores connection data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing users or roles is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is granted to the systemHealth and auditLogs collections.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for user-specific data under `/users/{userId}`.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  The rules do not implement any denormalization. However, for team-based access control to be fully enforced, the team document could include a `members` map to avoid future `get()` calls.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Public data (systemHealth, auditLogs) is stored in top-level collections, while private user data (favoriteActions) is stored in user subcollections.
